When you make a purchase using one of these affiliate links, we get paid a small commission at no extra cost to you.\nMadrid is the largest city in Spain. There is a lot to do here, from visiting its long list of art museums, exploring the city center, and day tripping to nearby destinations. When it comes to planning your Madrid itinerary, there several things to consider.\nThe first thing is how much time will you have?\n3 or more days in Madrid is ideal, because this is enough time to explore the city and plan a day trip or two.\nThe second is how much time should you spend in Madrid and how much time should you dedicate to day trips from Madrid.\nThere are some truly remarkable day trips to take (we loved Toledo!) and for some people, these can be overall better experiences than visiting the museums and attractions in Madrid.\nWe spent 8 busy days in Madrid, splitting our time between city sights and day trips, and we have a lot of information to share with you.\nThis guide starts with a brief overview the best day trips to take, how to spend one and two days in Madrid, and then continues with sample itineraries on a longer visit to Madrid (up to one week).\nLet’s get started.\nTable of Contents\nToggle\nHow Much Time Do You Need in Madrid?\nDay Trips from Madrid\nMadrid Itinerary Suggestions\n24 Hours in Madrid\nTwo Busy Days in Madrid\n3 Days in Madrid\n4 Days in Madrid\n5 Days in Madrid\n6 Days in Madrid\n7 Days in Madrid\nWhere to Stay in Madrid\nFrequently Asked Questions\nHow Much Time Do You Need in Madrid?\nIn 24 hours, you have barely enough time to visit a few of Madrid’s most popular attractions. On this list is the Prado National Museum, the Royal Palace, and a few must-sees in the city center.\nTwo days gives you enough time to add in a few more important landmarks, plus add in a hidden gem or two, or a food tour of Madrid.\nEach additional day you add beyond two days gives you enough time to take a day trip from Madrid (there are a lot to choose from and you can easily spend 3 or 4 days just doing day trips) or dive deeper in Madrid’s sights. Madrid is filled with art museums, so if you are an art lover, plan on spending at least three days just to visit the city of Madrid.\nTo get an idea of what to do in Madrid, take a look at our article\nBest Things to Do in Madrid.\nDay Trips from Madrid\nBefore we list the various Madrid itineraries, it’s important to know about the many wonderful day trips you can take from Madrid. From Madrid, it is easy to visit a handful of small cities, a palace or two, or even tour a nearby wine region.\nMadrid is a wonderful city to visit, but our favorite experiences were the day trips, which we found to be more interesting than spending time within the city itself.\nMadrid Day Trips\nTop 10 Day Trips from Madrid (+ Exactly How to Plan Them)\nBest day trips from Madrid and everything you need to know to plan them.\nIn our guide\nBest Day Trips from Madrid ↑\n, we cover these in much more detail, but here is a list of places to consider visiting. Many of these can combined (for example, Segovia + Ávila is a popular combination) into one day trip.\nToledo.\nThis is our favorite day trip from Madrid. It’s easy to get to, super fun to visit, extremely photogenic, and full of unique experiences. It is best to dedicate a full day to Toledo, as there is a lot to do here.\nToledo\nSegovia.\nThis beautiful city is famous for its aqueduct, alcazar, and picturesque city center.\nSegovia\nÁvila.\nThis small city is surrounded by well-preserved medieval walls. Walking these walls is the #1 thing to do here and a visit is rather quick, so it is easy to add on Segovia or El Escorial.\nÁvila\nThe Royal Site of San Lorenzo de El Escorial.\nThis is the largest Renaissance building in the world, a burial site for Spanish kings, and a UNESCO World Heritage Site. It is located near Ávila.\nEl Escorial Library\nThe Royal Palace of Aranjuez.\nThis is one of the residences of the royal family. It is one of the easiest day trips from Madrid, being located just outside of the city. Strolling the gardens is one of the best things to do here.\nThe Royal Palace of Aranjuez\nThe Consuegra Windmills.\nThis landscape, with twelve windmills dotting the top of Calderico ridge, is said to have inspired Miguel de Cervantes’ novel\nDon Quixote\n. It is located in Consuegra, a tiny town southeast of Madrid.\nConsuegra Windmills\nRibera del Duero.\nThis wine region is located in Castile and Leon, about a 2-hour drive north of Madrid. The easiest way to day trip to this region is on a tour.\nFrom Madrid, it is also possible to day trip to Córdoba, Seville, Salamanca, and Barcelona, but since these cities are relatively large and packed with a lot to see and do, and there is a fair amount of travel time to get to them, we think it is best to spend at least a full 24 hours in each of them.\nMadrid Itinerary Suggestions\nThis starts off with one day in Madrid and each itinerary builds on the one before it.\n24 Hours in Madrid\nWith one well planned day, you can visit Madrid’s top attractions. On this list is the Royal Palace, the Prado National Museum, Mercado San Miguel, and Barrio de la Latina, one of Madrid’s oldest neighborhoods.\nWe outline exactly how to do this in our\nOne Day in Madrid Itinerary,\nbut here is an overview:\n9:00 am:\nParque del Retiro\n10:00 am:\nPrado National Museum\n12:30 pm:\nPalacio de Cibeles & Mirador Madrid\n1:15 pm:\nAzotea del Círculo\n2:30 pm:\nCity Center (Plazas, Chocolate & Churros)\n3:30 pm:\nMercado San Miguel\n4:30 pm:\nRoyal Palace of Madrid\n7:00 pm:\nBarrio de La Latina\n1 Day in Madrid\nOne Perfect Day in Madrid: Best of Madrid in 24 Hours\nDetailed one day itinerary for Madrid, with more photos, walking route, and which tickets to purchase in advance.\nGran Via\nAlmudena Cathedral\nThe view from Mirador Madrid\nHere is a map of the places to visit and a walking route through the city.\nHow to Use This Map:\nClick the icons on the map to get more information about each point of interest. To take this map with you, click the star next to the title of the map which adds it to your Google account. Next, within your Google Maps app, select ‘Saved’ and then select ‘Maps’. This map title will now appear in your list.\nChoosing Which Art Museum to Visit\nThe Prado National Museum is Madrid’s most popular art museum to visit, and the #1 attraction in the city. It contains the largest collection of Spanish art in the world. However, there are two nearby museums that you can visit instead, if you have no interest in the Prado National Museum.\nThe\nReina Sofia Museum\ncontains a large collection of 20th century art, much of this being Impressionist and Expressionist paintings. The most famous work of art is Picasso’s\nGuernica\n.\nThe\nThyssen-Bornemisza Museum\nhas artworks by English, Dutch, Italian, and German artists. Famous artworks include Paul Cezanne’s\nSeated Man\n, Edgar Degas’\nSwaying Dancer\n, Edouard Manet’s\nHorsewoman\n, Van Gogh’s\nLes Vessenots in Auvers\n, and Dalí’s\nDream Caused by the Flight of a Bee\n.\nVan Gogh’s\nLes Vessenots in Auvers\nin the Thyssen-Bornemisza Museum\nTwo Busy Days in Madrid\nAdding a second day in Madrid allows you to split up the visits to the Prado National Museum and the Royal Palace onto two separate days. These are the busiest places to visit in Madrid and it is best to visit each of them first thing in the day, before they get overly crowded.\nThe extra time also allows you to add in another art museum or two (great for art aficionados), a food tour or tapas crawl (great for foodies), or a tour of the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium (great for sports fans).\nTake a look at our\n2 Day Madrid Itinerary\nfor the full breakdown of each day, including how to book your tickets, where to eat, and a lot more photos.\nHere is a brief overview of each day.\nDay 1\nMorning:\nParque del Retiro and the Prado National Museum\nMidday:\nPalacio de Cibeles, Mirador Madrid, and lunch at Azotea del Círculo\nAfternoon:\nMadrid city center\nEvening:\nBarrio de la Latina\nBarrio de la Latina\nDay 2\nMorning:\nRoyal Palace of Madrid\nMidday:\nAlmudena Cathedral and Mercado San Miguel\nAfternoon & Evening:\nTake your pick from several options.\nThere are several different ways to spend this afternoon in Madrid. Those with an interest in art can visit the Reina Sofia Museum and/or the Thyssen-Bornemisza Museum. Taking a tour of the\nSantiago Bernabéu Stadium\nis a popular thing to do in Madrid and you can also attend a football match or concert, depending on the schedule of events at the stadium. And finally, you have the option taking a\ntapas food tour\nof Madrid.\nRoyal Palace of Madrid\nSpain Travel Guide\nSee all of our articles about Spain\n3 Days in Madrid\nWith three days in Madrid, follow the 2 Day Madrid Itinerary and then do one day trip, or spend all three days in Madrid.\n3 Full Days in Madrid\nDay 1: Madrid\nMorning:\nParque del Retiro and the Prado National Museum\nMidday:\nPalacio de Cibeles, Mirador Madrid, and lunch at Azotea del Círculo\nAfternoon:\nMadrid city center\nEvening:\nBarrio de la Latina\nDay 2: Madrid\nMorning:\nRoyal Palace of Madrid\nMidday:\nAlmudena Cathedral and Mercado San Miguel\nAfternoon & Evening:\nSantiago Bernabéu Stadium or a tapas food tour\nDay 3: Madrid\nMorning:\nCerralbo Museum, Temple of Debod, and Plaza de España\nMidday:\nLunch.

However, if you’re just passing through, we think 7 days in Madrid is perfect for getting to know the city. You’ll be able to see all the iconic tourist sights and get off the beaten path to see how the locals live. Ready? Here’s your plan for\n7 days in Madrid\nthat you will never forget.\nReady to explore Madrid? Vámonos!\nContents\nhide\n1\nDay 1: Sightseeing in the city center + food tour\n2\nDay 2: Museums & markets\n3\nDay 3: Salamanca, shopping & soccer\n4\nDay 4: Day trip to Toledo\n5\nDay 5: Chueca & Chamberí\n6\nDay 6: La Latina & Lavapiés\n7\nDay 7: Casa de Campo Park\nDay 1: Sightseeing in the city center + food tour\nStart off the morning at Plaza Mayor, one of Madrid’s most famous squares—if not THE most famous. Take some time to stroll around and get some great pictures without the tourist crowds that will inevitably fill the square later in the day!\nFrom there, head to Mercado de San Miguel (\nPlaza de San Miguel, s/n\n) for breakfast. Like Plaza Mayor, this buzzing market gets packed in the afternoon and evening. However, as the vendors are just opening up shop first thing in the morning, there’s hardly a soul in the place. Starting off your 7 days in Madrid with a relaxing breakfast here is the best of both worlds. You’ll be able to experience Madrid’s most iconic market in peace and quiet—you may even have the place to yourself.\nThe Mercado de San Miguel is worth visiting for the beautiful architecture alone.\nAfter that, continue up Calle Mayor towards Almudena Cathedral and the Royal Palace\n.\nThese must-see sights are among the most important stops you’ll make during your 7 days in Madrid! Although Spain’s royal family actually lives in a smaller palace just outside Madrid, the Royal Palace is still considered their official residence and used ceremoniously. The grandiose interior will take your breath away.\nInsider’s Tip\n: To avoid long lines. be sure to reserve visits to monuments and museums – such as the Royal Palace – online in advance.\nAfter visiting the palace, be sure to take some time to explore the beautiful surrounding area. Plaza de Oriente just opposite the royal landmark is a beautiful place to sit and relax. If you continue a bit north, you’ll eventually make it to Plaza de España and the Temple of Debod. This is a real ancient Egyptian temple that was relocated to Spain brick by brick! Head behind the temple for amazing views of the cathedral and Casa de Campo park.\nYou can’t miss the Almudena Cathedral and Royal Palace during your 7 days in Madrid. Photo credit: Erica Zhao\nEnd the first of your 7 days in Madrid with our\nMadrid Tapas, Taverns, and History Tour\n.\nThis small group evening tour will show you the ins and outs of Madrid’s world-famous tapas scene. You’ll taste some of our favorite tapas and meet the people behind them at some of our favorite family-run bars. Additionally, you’ll leaved armed with valuable knowledge about how to eat like a local during the rest of your time in Madrid.\nTapas are an essential part of the Madrid experience.\nDay 2: Museums & markets\nIt’s the second of your 7 days in Madrid! Take this day to appreciate a few of Madrid’s fascinating museums. Madrid is home to the world-famous “art triangle” composed of three of the world’s finest art museums: the Prado, the Reina Sofia, and the Thyssen. Even if you’re not much of an art fan, you’ll be able to appreciate the incredible quality of the collections housed at these three museums. All three are relatively close (15 minutes or less walking distance), making this the perfect way to spend a day full of culture.\nMadrid’s Prado is considered one of the top art museums in the world.\nGet some fresh air between museum visits at Parque del Buen Retiro, the most famous of Madrid’s plentiful green spaces. Marvel at the sunlight dancing off the glass in the crystal palace and enjoy a relaxing boat ride on the small but beautiful lake inside the park.\nA long day of walking around museums and the park is bound to make you hungry. Grab lunch at the nearby Mercado de Antón Martín. Despite its unbeatable location in the city center, this market is nothing but local. Many of Madrid’s markets are home to great bars and restaurants, and Antón Martín is no exception. Some of our favorites here are El Tarantín de Lucía, Fiaschetteria La Saletta and Yokaloka for great seafood, Italian, and sushi respectively.\nIn addition to wonderful restaurants, Antón Martín also has wonderful deli counters and specialty foods shops.\nDay 3: Salamanca, shopping & soccer\nSpend the third of your 7 days in Madrid appreciating its rich modern culture! Start the day off with a fabulous brunch in the ritzy Salamanca neighborhood. After that, take some time to stroll down some of the city’s most stylish avenues. Madrid’s shopping culture is iconic, and there’s no better place to appreciate that than within the Salamanca neighborhood.\nStart your day off right with breakfast or brunch in the Salamanca neighborhood.\nThis beautiful barrio is home to some more spectacular museums, such as the National Archaeological Museum\nand the\nNational Museum of Natural Sciences. Try to take some time to visit one (or both!) and learn something new about the fascinating world we live in. The science museum is particularly great for kids.\nEven if you’re not much of a sports fan, be sure to head to Santiago Bernabéu Stadium, home of the Real Madrid soccer team. Take a tour of the stadium to get a sense as to how this team has shaped the culture of Spain’s capital and beyond. The visit will take you all across the stadium, from panoramic views to a walk through the locker and press rooms to stepping out onto the field itself. If it’s soccer season during your visit, be sure to stick around for a game.\nDay 4: Day trip to Toledo\nMadrid has so much to offer, but sometimes you need a break from the busy city! Now that your 7 days in Madrid are about halfway up, take advantage of the city’s proximity to some of the most beautiful parts of Spain. There are so many amazing cities and towns within reach thanks to the AVE, but the quintessential day trip from Madrid is definitely Toledo.\nWith its medieval streets, Roman remnants and influences from each of the three major world religions, Toledo will transport you back in time. It’s packed with history and culture, but small enough to see in a day. It also boasts a fantastic foodie culture and is said to be the birthplace of marzipan.\nToledo is a city of 3 cultures: a Judaic, Christian, and Islamic melting pot.\nStep back in time and savor the\nflavors of Toledo on a guided food and history tour\n. From medieval landmarks to mouthwatering local specialties, this unforgettable experience is just a short trip from Madrid—book your spot today!\nDay 5: Chueca & Chamberí\nNow that you’re back in the capital, take today to explore two of Madrid’s most authentic, off-the-beaten-path neighborhoods. Start the day in peaceful Chamberí, one of the most truly local\nbarrios\nleft in Madrid. Hardly any tourists make it up this way. The streets are filled with the same vibrant local life that has been there for decades.\nEnjoy a leisurely breakfast in picturesque Plaza de Chamberí, then head to one of the most fascinating (and possibly haunted!) places in Madrid:\nAndén 0\n(Platform 0). Once a stop along the Madrid metro, the station has been out of use since 1966. This fascinating station still looks much the same as it did when it opened in 1919, with antique furniture and billboards. It’s also completely free!\nAfter taking some more time to stroll around Chamberí, head south to trendy Chueca. As the unofficial capital of Madrid’s LGBT scene, this bohemian\nbarrio\nis renowned for its open, accepting culture. Pop into Mercado de San Ildefonso for a bite to eat. Then, it’s time for a shopping spree! Chueca is full of hip little boutiques where you can find some of the most unique keepsakes and souvenirs.\nEnd the fifth of your 7 days in Madrid with some\nvino\n! Chueca is full of fantastic places to enjoy great wine. We love the wine tastings at Reserva y Cata. If you want to do a"

Lunch is the main meal for many Spaniards (often 2-4 PM) – look for excellent value\nMenú del Día\n(weekday set lunch menus). Enjoy\nsobremesa\n(lingering at the table after eating).\nSafety:\nGenerally safe, but be very aware of pickpockets in crowded tourist areas (Puerta del Sol, Gran Vía, Plaza Mayor, Metro), especially targeting phones and wallets.

Madrid offers it all and, in general, you will be able to find suitable accommodation for your budget.\nOn the low end, there are countless hostels such as\nThe Hat Madrid\nthat can be great for backpackers and solo travellers looking to save some cash and meet others.\nExpect a bed in a dorm room to start at around €30 per night and for prices to go up from there depending on the number of beds, if the room is en suite etc. A hostel, in general, is the most budget-friendly accommodation option.\nPeaceful Retiro Park\nMid-range visitors looking for a basic, central hotel room such as in\nHostal Foster\nwill find that most rooms in the city centre another popular\nMadrid barrios to stay\nin average around €100-150 per night depending on the season, location and demand.\nIf you’re interested in staying in a private apartment rental, then a one-bedroom apartment in a central neighbourhood will cost around the same.\nThere are also plenty of luxury hotels such as\nOnly YOU Boutique Hotel\nscattered throughout the city that are a great option for those looking for an upmarket stay in the city.\nThese, as well, can range in price depending on location, availability and season, however, expect the average cost of a luxury hotel room to start at €250-300 per night and to go up from there.\nOn average, whether you’re travelling solo and staying in a hostel dorm or splitting the cost of a hotel room between two, plan to spend about €30-150 per person per day on accommodation while visiting Madrid.\nPlaza Mayor in Madrid\nTransportation Prices\nMadrid is a massive, spread-out metropolis and it is unrealistic to assume you can walk everywhere you need to go. However, it is also blessed with an excellent public transport system including extensive buses and a vast metro and train network.\nMadrid’s public transit is affordable and reliable and if you’re staying in or close to the city centre, there is no reason that you will ever need a vehicle of your own.\nBut how much does this amazing public transportation system cost? Well, there are a few different answers to that question.\nThe most simple answer is, unless you are taking the metro to the airport (where you will have to pay a supplementary cost), then a single journey on the metro or bus will cost €1.50-2, depending on which zone you’re travelling in.\nMetro sign in Madrid\nIt is worth noting that you do need to purchase a Multi Card (Tarjeta Multi) for a flat fee of €2.50 before you can get any transit tickets. You can actually share this card between people, so you only need to purchase one per party, not one per person.\nNow, this is where things get a bit more complicated. For instance, if you’re a visitor in Madrid for longer than a day or and plan to use the metro a fair amount, it makes little financial sense to purchase a single-journey fare every time you ride.\nInstead of this, you can purchase a 10-journey ticket that will cost you €12.20. This works out to €1.22 per journey – and keep in mind that it can be shared between people.\nMadrid is an easy city to get around by public transportation and by foot, and if you’re trying to cut down on your total daily travel budget, then that is all the transportation you might need. However, it is worth knowing that taxis and Uber are available in the city as well.\nUsing both of these services frequently can work out to be fairly expensive, however, so if you’re trying to save money in Madrid, I would recommend relying on the bus, the metro, or your humble feet for transport instead.\nAnother thing to consider is if you’re planning on going on any day trips from Madrid because this can factor into your daily transport costs. You can reach popular towns like\nToledo\n,\nSegovia\nand\nÁvila\nwithin an hour or so on the train, but this does cost a bit. Expect a basic return train journey to a city like\nToledo or Segovia\nto cost about €20 per person. You\ncan pre-book trains here\n.\nIn general, if you plan to use public transport to get around Madrid itself and also plan to take a day trip out of the city, then plan to spend about €5-10 per person per day during your trip to the Spanish capital.\nBeautiful Segovia\nFood Prices\nOne of the top things to consider when planning a trip to the capital of Spain is the cost of food. And while Spain — including its capital city — is known for its affordable food, it’s still a good idea to know how much to expect to spend on meals in the city, especially if you’re trying to visit Madrid on a budget.\nMadrid, and Spain in general, is a foodie heaven. Madrid boasts an incredible local cuisine and, due to the fact that it is very much an international city, you can get just about every kind of food you would like here as well.\nMadrid is also famous for its tapas culture and you truly wouldn’t experience the city to its full potential if you didn’t take advantage of the scene often – it’s definitely one of the best things to do in Madrid!\nHowever, eating out frequently can definitely add up. If you like eating out but want to make sure you get your best value for money, then I would recommend setting your sites on lunch rather than dinner.\nIn Spanish culture, lunch is the biggest meal of the day and most local restaurants offer incredible deals on a menu del día or daily menu.\nIf you stray away from a touristy restaurant, we often paid between €10-15 for a massive meal that includes a glass of wine or beer (or a soft drink), a large first course (usually a salad or soup), hot second course, and either a dessert or coffee.\nMost restaurants will typically only offer a set menu on Monday-Friday, however, there are definitely restaurants that offer the same thing on weekends as well, though it is often a bit more expensive.\nChoosing the set Menu del Dia for lunch can be excellent value for money\nEating and drinking in Madrid is inextricably linked, and we’ll discuss drink prices in the “entertainment” section, however, it’s worth noting that in more local Madrid bars, you will often get a small tapa with a drink order. This is normally a couple of croquetas or some anchovies, however, can be as large as a slice of tortilla. It depends on where you go.\nIf you’re keen to head out for tapas, again, these can vary in price. A small\ntapa\nthat isn’t included with a drink order like a slice of tortilla or patatas bravas will likely only cost about €3-4. However, if you plan to eat a bit more and order some raciones, or larger portions, expect to pay between €8-12 depending on what is in the dish.\nThe more local and less trendy the place, the less expensive it is bound to be. Keep in mind that you can also order half-portions (or media raciones) in many bars and this will be the size between a full ración and a tapa. They tend to be a couple of euros cheaper than a full portion.l\nThose who want to cook their own meals here and there will find that there are ample supermarkets scattered throughout the city, however, if you truly want to immerse yourself in the Madrileño culture, then shopping at the local mercados (though\nnot\nthe Mercado de San Miguel, which is a tapas market more catered toward tourists) is a far better thing to do.\nNot only will you support the local economy, but you will also be able to really see what Spanish life is all about.\nAlso, the quality of p"
